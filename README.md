# Image Caption Generator

This project implements an Image Caption Generator using a combination of transfer learning with the VGG16 model and a customized LSTM neural network. The generated captions provide descriptive information about the content of the input images.

## Contents

- [model.ipynb](model.ipynb): Jupyter Notebook containing the code for training the model using transfer learning with pre-trained VGG16 and building a customized LSTM neural network.
- [app.py](app.py): Streamlit web application for deploying the trained model, allowing users to generate captions for images interactively.

## Overview

### Flickr8k Dataset

The model is trained on the Flickr8k dataset, which comprises 8,000 images gathered from the photo-sharing platform Flickr. Each image is associated with five descriptive captions, providing diverse textual descriptions for various scenes and subjects.

### Transfer Learning using Pre-trained VGG16

The project utilizes a pre-trained VGG16 model for feature extraction. The final classification layer is removed to enable access to the model's output features. The modified VGG16 model extracts image features, which are then used to train a customized LSTM neural network for generating captions.

### Building Customized LSTM Neural Network

The LSTM model consists of an encoder and decoder. The encoder processes image features extracted by VGG16, while the decoder generates captions using an attention mechanism. The model is trained using the Flickr8k dataset to learn the relationships between images and their corresponding captions.

### Streamlit Web Application

The web application (`app.py`) allows users to upload images and receive instant captions generated by the trained model. It provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the Image Caption Generator.

## Usage

### Training the Model

Refer to the [model.ipynb](model.ipynb) notebook for details on training the Image Caption Generator model. The notebook covers data preprocessing, model architecture, training, and evaluation using BLEU scores.

### Deploying the Web Application

To deploy the Streamlit web application, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
